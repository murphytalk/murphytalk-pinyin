This is a [Chinese pinyin input method(IME)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_input_method) for [Sharp Zaurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Zaurus) SL-Cxx series and SL-5xxx series devices. It also supports the other [Qtopia/opie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qtopia) based handheld systems.

I wrote it in 2004 to input Chinese on my Zaurus SL-C750, and shared the first stable version with a handheld device online community [Hi-PDA](http://www.hi-pda.com/forum/) . Before long people started to request new features, that's when I decided to open the source. Originally it was hosted on [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/murphypinyin/).

It turns out it is the first (open source) Chinese IME on Qtopia platform, attracted quite a bit of attentions, especially after Qtopia was widely adopted by many Linux based embedded mobile device manufactures in China.
 
Although I have lost the interests to Zaurus years ago, it is amazing that after so many years, I am still getting mails from people requesting new features and asking how to address problems arose when it is being migrated to other platforms.
